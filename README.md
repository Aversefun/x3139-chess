# X3139 Chess

15 sliding puzzle, but chess! Inspired by [xkcd 3139](https://xkcd.com/3139). Currently supports most chess features, including:

- Castling
- En passant
- Showing available moves
- Requiring you to get out of check if you are in check
- Checkmate detection (because of the tiles it is possible to capture the king, so this is regarded as a checkmate)

Stuff that will be implemented Soon :tm::

- nothing, make an issue if you have a suggestion

Stuff that will probably never be implemented:

- Pawn promotion - pawns are still useful after they reach the back rank because of the tiles, and because of the tiles it's easier to get them to the back rank
